# Customer-Segmentation-and-Target-Marketing-Carmax



This project was my entry for the [2021 CarMax Analytics Showcase](https://analyticsshowcase.carmax.com/) that sought to answer the following question:

**In todayâ€™s marketplace, customers expect and demand a personalized experience. Given historical industry sales, how can CarMax tailor its marketing and inventory strategies to draw in distinct segments of consumers?**

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains my detailed analysis and recommendations for this problem. In it, I'll identify distinct segments of customers with a high lifetime value, use classification models to predict a customer's purchase price and vehicle from their demographic info, and create distinct groups of purchases (using k-means clustering) that could be utilized in a post-purchase marketing mix.
